### Image Classification: Glasses Detection
## Backstory & Scope:
Glasses which are known as eyeglasses or spectacles ,are typically used for vision correction, such as with reading. Also, there are other types of glasses such as safety glasses,
sunglasses, and specialized glasses like 3D glasses.

The goal of this project is to build a neural network model that uses image data to predict whether someone is wearing a glasses or not using classification models to find 
the best model, after clustering the images.

## Data Description:
The data for this project is from Kaggle.com (Find the dataset on the following [link](https://www.kaggle.com/jeffheaton/glasses-or-no-glasses)). The obtained dataset consists 5000 images of people wearing different shapes of glasses and people who does not wear glasses. at the first the data should be clustered into two parts (glasses and No-glasses) then the best classification model will choosing based on the accuracy and the overfitting.
